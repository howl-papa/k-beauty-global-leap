# 사업 개요

## 🎯 The Opportunity / 시장 기회

**중소 K-Beauty 기업의 글로벌 진출, AI가 답입니다**

한국 화장품은 글로벌 시장에서 검증된 경쟁력을 가지고 있습니다. 그러나 **중소기업의 95%는 해외 진출에 실패**합니다. 이유는 단순합니다:

- 🚫 **시장 조사 비용**: 컨설팅사 의뢰 시 수천만원 (중소기업 예산의 30-50%)
- 🚫 **문화적 장벽**: 독일에서 "미백"은 인종차별, 일본에서 "화이트닝"은 OK
- 🚫 **잘못된 파트너**: 인플루언서 80%가 가짜 팔로워 보유
- 🚫 **마케팅 실패**: 타겟 시장 트렌드 파악 불가

**우리의 솔루션**: AI 기반 시장 인텔리전스를 **월 $50**에 제공하여 중소기업이 대기업과 동등하게 경쟁할 수 있게 합니다.

```

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Basic Tier**:
```
ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): $50/month
Churn Rate: 15% monthly → Avg. Lifetime: 6.7 months
LTV: $50 × 6.7 = $335

```

**Pro Tier**:
```
ARPU: $200/month
Churn Rate: 8% monthly → Avg. Lifetime: 12.5 months
LTV: $200 × 12.5 = $2,500

LTV/CAC Ratio: $2,500 / $200 = 12.5 ✅ (excellent)
```

**Enterprise Tier**:
```
ARPU: $1,800/month (average)
Churn Rate: 5% monthly → Avg. Lifetime: 20 months
LTV: $1,800 × 20 = $36,000

LTV/CAC Ratio: $36,000 / $500 = 72 ✅ (exceptional)
```

- **Mitigation**: 6-12 month first-mover advantage
- **Moat**: Proprietary K-Beauty dataset (500K+ posts)
- **Strategy**: Fast execution, lock in customers early

**4. Execution Risk: Team too small**
- **Mitigation**: Investment will expand team to 5 people
- **Advisory Board**: 3 industry experts committed
- **Outsourcing**: Contract developers for non-core features

**5. Regulatory Risk: Data privacy (GDPR, etc.)**
